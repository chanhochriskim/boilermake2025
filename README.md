# Chick-fi-Lingo üêîüçü

Chick-fi-Lingo is a Chick-fil-A-themed ordering application designed to enhance accessibility for individuals who may not be fluent in English. Whether at the drive-thru or on a phone call, Chick-fi-Lingo‚Äôs AI-powered Lingo Bot could ensure a smooth and inclusive ordering experience by supporting multiple languages‚Äîeven allowing users to switch languages mid-sentence. 

## Inspiration
Inspired by Purdue's infamous on-campus Chick-fil-A, we thought it would be great to create an AI bot named Lingo that interacts with users based on their orders. Lingo can handle multiple languages, so we combined Chick-fil-A with DuoLingo to come up with the name 'Chick-Fi-Lingo'!

## What it does
We aimed to provide a seamless front-end experience while handling multiple languages during the ordering process, ensuring that Lingo Bot offers its users a smooth and efficient ordering experience.

## How we built it
We used a variety of technologies and tools to implement this full-stack project, incorporating Flask to bridge the gap between the frontend and backend.

## Challenges we ran into
We initially planned to implement a cloud-based backend using AWS but encountered limitations while training the model through SageMaker. As it was our first time working with AWS and AI/ML, this led to unexpected challenges. Ultimately, we used OpenAI and DeepSink features to implement the backend functionality.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite facing unexpected challenges, we gained valuable insights, particularly in backend development, and enhanced the website‚Äôs aesthetics and engagement through TypeScript.

## What we learned
We gained hands-on experience with the basics of AI/ML, and learned how to interlink the backend and frontend, and, as this was our first full-stack development project with AI implementation, we encountered valuable learning opportunities throughout the process.

## What's next for Chick-fi-Lingo
In our eyes, the real-world application of Chick-fi-Lingo is in drive-thrus and ordering by phone, where individuals who are less comfortable ordering in English can feel free to order in any language they want - even switching languages mid-sentence! Looking ahead, we aim to add more robust features, making sure the website correctly sizes to different devices or platforms. Additionally, we plan to develop a model trained on keywords and datasets. Launching Chick-Fi-Lingo at Purdue's Chick-fil-A could also present a great business opportunity, as it would help international students feel less pressured when ordering, with Lingo Bot offering support in any language.
